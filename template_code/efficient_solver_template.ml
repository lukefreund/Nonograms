  Generates all possible configurations for a line (row or column) based on constraints.
  @param constraints: List of block sizes for the line.
  @param line_length: Total length of the line.
  @return A list of all valid configurations for the line.

  Hint:
  - Base Case: If there are no constraints, fill the remaining length with empty cells.
  - Recursive Case: Generate all valid prefixes for the current block and combine with configurations for the remaining constraints.

  Hint: Use `List.filter` and `List.for_all2` to compare each possibility with the current line state.

(* 
  Propagates constraints across rows and columns to narrow down possibilities.
  Updates the grid state as new information is discovered.
  @param state: The current solving state.
  @raise Contradiction: If a contradiction is found during propagation.

  Hint:
  1. Update row and column possibilities by comparing them with the current grid state.
  2. Use `intersect_line_possibilities` to refine the grid for known cells.
  3. Recurse until no changes occur, or a contradiction is found.

(* 
  Recursive function to solve the Nonogram using constraint propagation and branching.
  @param state: The current solving state.
  @return Some solution grid if solvable, None otherwise.

  Hint:
  1. Use `propagate_constraints` to narrow possibilities.
  2. If the grid is not completely solved, choose a row or column to branch on.
  3. Recursively try all possibilities for that row/column.

  Efficient solver for Nonogram puzzles.

  @raises Failure: If no solution exists for the given puzzle.

  Hint:
  1. Initialize the grid and possibilities for rows and columns.
  2. Use `solve` to attempt solving the puzzle.
  3. Track performance using timing functions (optional).
