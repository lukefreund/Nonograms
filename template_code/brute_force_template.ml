open Nonogram

(* 
  Generates all sequences of cells for a row that satisfy the given constraints.
  @param constraints: The list of block sizes for the row.
  @param row_length: The total length of the row.
  @return A list of all valid configurations for the row.

  Hint: Use a recursive helper function to process the constraints.
  - Base Case: If there are no constraints, fill the remaining space with empty cells.
  - Recursive Case: For each block in the constraints, prepend it with empty cells, followed by the block, 
    and recursively solve for the remaining constraints.

(* 
  Extracts the columns from the grid.
  @param grid: A 2D list representing the grid.
  @return A list of lists, where each inner list represents a column of the grid.

  Hint: Transpose the grid by iteratively collecting the first element of each row into a column, 
  and then repeat for the remaining elements.

(* 
  Computes the constraints of a given line (row or column).
  @param line: A list of cells representing the line.
  @return A list of integers representing the block sizes in the line.

  Hint: Use a recursive helper function to traverse the line.
  - Maintain a counter for consecutive filled cells.
  - Reset the counter when an empty cell is encountered, adding the count to the constraints list.

(* 
  Checks if the grid's columns satisfy the column constraints.
  @param grid: The grid to check.
  @param col_constraints: The list of constraints for each column.
  @return True if all columns satisfy their constraints, false otherwise.

  Hint: Use the `columns_of_grid` function to extract columns and then compare 
  each column's constraints (using `line_constraints`) to the provided constraints.

(* 
  Generates all combinations of row possibilities.
  @param lists: A list of lists, where each inner list represents possible configurations for a row.
  @return A list of lists, where each inner list represents a possible grid.

  Hint: Use recursion to combine the head of the list with all combinations of the tail.
  - Base Case: An empty list of lists should return a list containing an empty grid.
  - Recursive Case: Combine each element of the current row's possibilities with the rest.

(* 
  Main solver function for the Nonogram puzzle using a brute-force approach.
  @param puzzle: The Nonogram puzzle, including row and column constraints.
  @return The solved grid as a 2D list of cells.

  Hint:
  1. Use `generate_row_possibilities` to compute all possibilities for each row.
  2. Use `all_combinations` to generate all possible grids.
  3. Filter grids using `check_columns` to find the one that satisfies column constraints.
  4. Time each step for performance analysis (optional).
